Simply put, availability is the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. This is often described as a mission capable rate. Mathematically, this is expressed as 100% minus unavailability. * The ratio of (a) the total time a functional unit is capable of being used during a given interval to (b) the length of the interval. For example, a unit that is capable of being used 100 hours per week (168 hours) would have an availability of 100/168. However, typical availability values are specified in decimal (such as 0.9998). In high availability applications, a metric known as nines, corresponding to the number of nines following the decimal point, is used. With this convention, \"five nines\" equals 0.99999 (or 99.999%) availability. (source: wikipedia)"@en ;

It can therefore be described as a \"process optimization process.\" It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, more effective and more capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach. These processes can impact the cost and revenue generation of an organization. As a policy-making approach, BPM sees processes as important assets of an organization that must be understood, managed, and developed to announce value-added products and services to clients or customers. This approach closely resembles other total quality management or continual improvement process methodologies and BPM proponents also claim that this approach can be supported, or enabled, through technology. As such, many BPM articles and scholars frequently discuss BPM from one of two viewpoints: people and/or technology. (source: wikipedia)"@en ;

It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services), which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers that may be located far from the user–ranging in distance from across a city to across the world. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over an electricity network. (source: wikipedia)"@en ;

Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, in different business, science, and social science domains. Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes. Business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing on business information. (source: wikipedia)"@en ;

Alternatively, data is deemed of high quality if it correctly represents the real-world construct to which it refers. Furthermore, apart from these definitions, as data volume increases, the question of internal consistency within data becomes significant, regardless of fitness for use for any particular external purpose. People's views on data quality can often be in disagreement, even when discussing the same set of data used for the same purpose. (source: wikipedia)"@en ;

The Data Transfer Project is an open source initiative to encourage participation of as many providers as possible. The DTP will enhance the data portability ecosystem by reducing the infrastructure burden on both providers and users, which should in turn increase the number of services offering portability. The protocols and methodology of the DTP enable direct, service-to-service data transfer with streamlined engineering work."@en ;

It enables analytics and knowledge generation to occur at the source of the data. This approach requires leveraging resources that may not be continuously connected to a network such as laptops, smartphones, tablets and sensors. Edge Computing covers a wide range of technologies including wireless sensor networks, mobile data acquisition, mobile signature analysis, cooperative distributed peer-to-peer ad hoc networking and processing also classifiable as Local Cloud/Fog computing and Grid/Mesh Computing, dew computing, mobile edge computing, cloudlet, distributed data storage and retrieval, autonomic self-healing networks, remote cloud services, augmented reality, and more.

In particular the Apps Generic Enablers supports managing applications, services and data in a business framework across the whole service life cycle from creation through composition of applications and data to monetization and revenue sharing.

A couple of basic GEs are important to realize the vision of such an applications, services and data business framework, which enables new business models in an agile and flexible way. Among them: a store, a marketplace, a revenue sharing engine, an application composer through mashup and a data visualization and analysis component.

The Business Framework is heavily relying on USDL as common uniform description format for services which does not only focus on technical aspects of service, but also on business aspects as well as functional and non-functional service attributes.

The Application Mashup GE aims at allowing end users without programming skills to quickly compose beautiful web applications and dashboards/cockpits mashing up widgets, operators and data sources from a shared catalogue.

The Data Visualisation GE aims at creating agile, beautiful visualizations and meaningful reports useful to present the large variety of datasets. Data stakeholders will bring in the play as well as providing customisable data analytics."""@en ;

Creating secured and trusted services without sacrificing much of the desired functionality, usability, performance and cost efficiency is a great challenge, especially in a dynamic environment where new threats and attack methods emerge on a daily basis.

The overall ambition of the Security Architecture of FIWARE is to demonstrate that the Vision of an Internet that is \"secure by design\" is becoming reality. Based on achievements to date and/or to come in the short-term (both from a technological but also a standardization perspective) we will show that \"secure by design\" is possible.

Security, Privacy and Trust in FIWARE is mainly focusing on delivering tools and techniques to have the above-mentioned security needs properly met. Furthermore a decision making support and the automation of countermeasures allow alleviating the workload of users and administrators while raising their security awareness.

This seventh edition supersedes the sixth edition (1993), its Amendment 1 (1994) and its Amendment 2 (1997). It constitutes a technical revision. The significant technical changes are: -the addition of the values of 230 V (50 Hz) and 230/400 V (60 Hz) to Table 1;-the replacement of the utilization voltage range at LV by a reference to the relevant standard and an informative annex;- the addition of the value of 30 kV to Table 3;- the replacement of the value of 1 050 kV by 1 100 kV in Table 5. It has the status of a horizontal standard in accordance with IEC Guide 108."@en ;

This standard includes specification of the protection function, measurement characteristics and test methodologies. The object is to establish a common and reproducible reference for evaluating dependent time relays which protect equipment from thermal damage by measuring a.c. current flowing through the equipment. Complementary input energizing quantities such as ambient, coolant, top oil and winding temperature may be applicable for the thermal protection specification set forth in this standard. This standard covers protection relays based on a thermal model with memory function."@en ;

A supervised premises transceiver can be a stand-alone device or an integrated part of an alarm system. These requirements also apply to the SPT sharing means of interconnection, control, communication and power supplies with other applications. The alarm transmission system requirements and classifications are defined within IEC 60839-5-1. This new edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition: reflects the current technological state of art (IP networks) ,harmonizes with the ATS categories introduced in IEC 60839-5-1:2014; introduces test requirements."@en ;

A complex automated industrial system such as manufacturing assembly line usually needs a distributed control system an organized hierarchy of controller systems to function. In this hierarchy, there is usually a Human Machine Interface (HMI) at the top, where an operator can monitor or operate the system. This is typically linked to a middle layer of programmable logic controllers (PLC) via a non-time-critical communications system (e.g. Ethernet). At the bottom of the control chain is the fieldbus that links the PLCs to the components that actually do the work, such as sensors, actuators, electric motors, console lights, switches, valves and contactors"@en ;

The Redline version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between this standard and its previous edition. The Redline version is not an official IEC Standard, only the current version of the standard is to be considered the official document.nnIEC 61400-25-4:2016 specifies the specific mappings to protocol stacks encoding the messages required for the information exchange between a client and a remote server for: data access and retrieval, device control, event reporting and logging, publisher/subscriber, self-description of devices (device data dictionary), data typing and discovery of data types. The mappings specified in this part of IEC 61400-25 comprise:n- a mapping to SOAP-based web services,n- a mapping to OPC/XML-DA,n- a mapping to IEC 61850-8-1 MMS,n- a mapping to IEC 60870-5-104,n- a mapping to DNP3.nThe main technical changes with regard to the previous edition are as follows:n- general harmonization with information models in IEC 61400-25-2 and information exchange services in IEC 61400-25-3;n- reduction of overlap between standards and simplification by increased referencing."@en ;

Object oriented concepts as encapsulation, classes, class libraries, instances, instance hierarchies, inheritance, relations, attributes and interfaces are explicitly supported. CAEX bases on XML and is defined as XML schema (xsd file). The original intention of developing CAEX was the industrial lack of a common and established data exchange between process engineering tools and process control engineering tools. However, CAEX can be applied to all types of static object information, e.g. plant topologies, document topologies, product topologies, petri nets, but also for non-technical applications like phylogenetic trees."@en ;

The purpose of ISO/PAS 17506:2012 is to provide a specification for the COLLADA schema in sufficient detail to enable software developers to create tools to process COLLADA resources. In particular, it is relevant to those who import to or export from digital content creation (DCC) applications, 3D interactive applications and tool chains, prototyping tools, real-time visualization applications such as those used in the video game and movie industries, and CAD tools. ISO/PAS 17506:2012 covers the initial design and specifications of the COLLADA schema, as well as a minimal set of requirements for COLLADA exporters. "@en ;

Freely available, open standards are used for all aspects of MTConnect. Data from shop floor devices is presented in XML format, and is retrieved from information providers, called Agents, using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as the underlying transport protocol. MTConnect provides a RESTful interface, which means the interface is stateless. No session must be established to retrieve data from an MTConnect Agent, and no logon or logoff sequence is required (unless overlying security protocols are added which do).

This role is described in the 2011 Federal Cloud Computing Strategy as “... a central one in defining and advancing standards, and collaborating with USG Agency CIOs, private sector experts, and international bodies to identify and reach consensus on cloud computing technology & standardization priorities.” This NIST Cloud Computing program and initiative to develop a USG Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap is one of several complementary and parallel USG initiatives defined in the broader Federal Cloud Computing Strategy referenced above. The Federal Cloud Computing Strategy characterizes cloud computing as a “profound economic and technical shift (with) great potential to reduce the cost of federal Information Technology (IT) systems while … improving IT capabilities and stimulating innovation in IT solutions.” In the technology vision of Federal Cloud Computing Strategy success, USG agencies will be able to easily locate desired IT services in a mature and competitive marketplace, rapidly procure access to these services, and use them to deliver innovative mission solutions. Cloud services will be secure, interoperable, and reliable. Agencies will be able to switch between providers easily and with minimal cost, and receive equal or superior service."@en ;

The common characteristics most interpretations share are on-demand scalability of highly available and reliable pooled computing resources, secure access to metered services from nearly anywhere, and displacement of data and services from inside to outside the organization. While aspects of these characteristics have been realized to a certain extent, cloud computing remains a work in progress. This publication provides an overview of the security and privacy challenges pertinent to public cloud computing and points out considerations organizations should take when outsourcing data, applications, and infrastructure to a public cloud environment."@en ;

ODVA’s mission is to advance open, interoperable information and communication technologies in industrial automation. ODVA recognizes its media independent network protocol, the Common Industrial Protocol or “CIP” — and the network adaptations of CIP — EtherNet/IP, DeviceNet, CompoNet and ControlNet — as its core technology and the primary common interest of its membership. For future interoperability of production systems and the integration of the production systems with other systems, ODVA embraces the adoption of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and standard, unmodified Internet and Ethernet technologies as a guiding principle wherever possible. This principle is exemplified by EtherNet/IP — the world’s number one industrial Ethernet network."@en ;

CoAP is designed to easily translate to HTTP for simplified integration with the web, while also meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity. The CoRE group has proposed the following features for CoAP: RESTful protocol design minimizing the complexity of mapping with HTTP, Low header overhead and parsing complexity, URI and content-type support, Support for the discovery of resources provided by known CoAP services. Simple subscription for a resource, and resulting push notifications, Simple caching based on max-age. (source: https://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-protocols/)"@en ;

For example, it can refer to the capability of a system to increase its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added. An analogous meaning is implied when the word is used in an economic context, where scalability of a company implies that the underlying business model offers the potential for economic growth within the company. Scalability, as a property of systems, is generally difficult to define and in any particular case it is necessary to define the specific requirements for scalability on those dimensions that are deemed important. It is a highly significant issue in electronics systems, databases, routers, and networking. (source: wikipedia)"@en ;

ILM includes every phase of a \"record\" from its beginning to its end.

Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user. The most common component of SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract. As an example, Internet service providers and telcos will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in terms of mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to repair or mean time to recovery (MTTR); identifying which party is responsible for reporting faults or paying fees; responsibility for various data rates; throughput; jitter; or similar measurable details.

A uniform, feasible procedure for ensuring IT security throughout the entire life cycle of automation devices, systems, and applications is described, based on common terms and definitions agreed by the manufacturers of automation devices and systems and their users (e.g., machine manufacturers, integrators, operators). The life cycle covers the development, integration, operation, migration, and decommissioning phases.This guideline defines a simple procedure model for the development and description of IT Security. The model consists of eight steps."@en ;

Many thousand experts carry out standardization work in the IEC in TCs (technical committees) and SCs (subcommittees), in hundreds of working groups, project and maintenance teams. They represent the national electrotechnical needs of IEC Member countries and of many Affiliates at the global level in the IEC. These technical experts are sent by industry, governments, test and research laboratories, academia and even consumer groups to work on the global, neutral and independent platform of the IEC.
